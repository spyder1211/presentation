# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains presentation materials for AI prompt engineering workshops focused on business efficiency improvements in local government settings. The materials demonstrate practical applications of generative AI prompts for municipal workflows.

## Repository Structure

- **HTML Presentations**: Self-contained HTML files with embedded CSS/JS for interactive slideshows
- **Supporting Images**: Screenshots showing AI output examples (FAQ generation, TODO extraction, receipt processing)
- **Documentation**: README.md with detailed file structure and usage instructions

## Key Files

### Presentation Files
- `index.html` - Main presentation (24 slides) covering prompt engineering theory and practical examples
- `業務活用プロンプト事例_presentation.html` - Older version with detailed design, kept as reference

### Documentation
- `README.md` - Comprehensive guide with file structure, keyboard controls, and slide contents

### Images
- `image.png` - Screenshot of meeting minutes FAQ generation results
- `image-1.png` - Screenshot of meeting minutes TODO extraction results  
- `image-2.png` - Receipt image sample
- `image-3.png` - Receipt processing results screenshot

## Presentation Controls

Both HTML presentations support:
- **Arrow keys (→ ←)**: Navigate slides
- **Spacebar**: Next slide
- **Home/End**: First/last slide
- **F11**: Full screen mode
- **Touch/swipe**: Mobile navigation

## Content Focus

The presentations cover:
1. Prompt engineering fundamentals (5-element framework)
2. Municipal workflow automation examples:
   - Email response generation
   - Meeting minutes analysis and FAQ creation
   - Task extraction from documents
   - Receipt/image processing
3. Prompt improvement techniques
4. Implementation roadmaps

## Technical Notes

- All presentations are standalone HTML files with embedded styling
- No external dependencies or build process required
- Optimized for desktop presentation with responsive mobile support
- Uses modern CSS features (flexbox, grid, animations)
- Keyboard and touch navigation implemented in vanilla JavaScript

## Usage

To view presentations:
1. Open HTML files directly in any modern web browser
2. Use F11 for full-screen presentation mode
3. Navigate with arrow keys or click navigation buttons
4. Press ESC to exit full-screen

## Development Approach

When working with these files:
- Maintain the self-contained nature of HTML presentations
- Preserve Japanese language content and municipal government context
- Keep responsive design for both desktop and mobile viewing
- Ensure accessibility through keyboard navigation
- Maintain the professional presentation styling and animations
